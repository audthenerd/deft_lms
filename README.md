## :paperclip: What is DEFT?
DEFT started off as a class project based on <b>React</b>, <b>Express.js</b> and <b>Node.js</b>. It is now an open-source application that facilitates the effective management of samples, equipment and associated data. Using this system will allow automated workflows and reproducibility of analysis results.

  ### Step 2: Choosing the Parameters
  Choosing the key components that are required in a lab management system was crucial to ensure that the application would   be efficient and controlled for traceability. Here is a list of them:<br>
  - <b>Permission Control</b>: Currently has 3 levels (Supervisor/Administrator, Chemist, Technician). Can be altered            according to the lab's hierachy. This controls who is able to access what.<br>
  - <b>Samples</b>: Add new samples, edit existing samples <br>
  - <b>Equipment</b>: Add new equipment, edit existing equipment <br>
  - <b>Test Methods</b>: Add new methods, edit existing methods, search for methods <br>
  - <b>Reports</b>: Generate reports from sample analysis results entered by the lab staff - WIP
